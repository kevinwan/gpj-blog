Description: Sigma Theme is a lightweight and responsive theme, with a fluid grid system that adapts your website to mobile devices and the desktop or any 
other viewing environment. The theme is early in development, and feedback is welcomed. The theme features full and with-sidebar page templates, sidebar, 
footer and home page widget areas. It is designed to work well with Event Organiser, and should also be compatible with most slider plug-ins and WordPress 
SEO. The theme is translation-ready and cross-browser compatible.
