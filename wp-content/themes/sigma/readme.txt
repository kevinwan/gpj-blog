Omega is a lightweight and responsive theme, with a fluid grid system based on getskeleton.com that adapts your website to mobiles, tablets and desktop devices. 
The theme is early in development, and feedback is welcomed. The theme features full and with-sidebar page templates, sidebar, footer and home page widget 
areas. It is designed to work well with Event Organiser, and should also be compatible with most slider plug-ins and WordPress SEO. The theme is 
translation-ready and cross-browser compatible.
